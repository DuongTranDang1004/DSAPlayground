                        // question 1:
    //                why not  min[i][j] = Math.min(min[i][i], X[j]);, I thought j is always 1 unit larger than i ?
                        //=> min[i][i] would always be the diagonal. Here we are trying to loop through the 2D Array's cell: from left to right (change columns), then from up to down (change rows)

                        //question 2:
                        //why not   min[i][j] = Math.min(min[i][j - 1], X[i]) ?
                        // => we want to compare with the end range, not start range 
                    }
